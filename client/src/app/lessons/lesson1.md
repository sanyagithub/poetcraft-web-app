# Lesson 1: The Importance of Poetic Meter

## Introduction

Annie Finch emphasizes the critical nature of sharing knowledge about poetic meter. She believes there's nothing more important than passing on this understanding.

## Why Meter Matters

1. In today's world, anyone can publish poetry online quickly.
2. People often define poetry broadly, with various interpretations.
3. However, meter adds a crucial dimension to poetry that's often overlooked.

## The Essence of a Poem

- Common definitions of poetry:
  - A piece of art representing society
  - Something that may or may not rhyme
  - Language open to interpretation
  - Evocative or original language
- These definitions often miss a key aspect: the rhythmic nature of poetry

## The Physical Connection

Meter in poetry creates a physical experience:
- It connects to our body's natural rhythms (heartbeat, breath)
- This physical connection helps us remember the words
- It takes poetry beyond mere brain activity into a full-body experience

## Conclusion

Understanding and appreciating meter is crucial for fully experiencing the power of poetry. It's not just about the words, but how they resonate with our physical being.
