# Lesson 3: Understanding Poetic Lines and Meter

## Introduction

This lesson explores the structure of poetic lines and how meter functions within them.

## Key Concepts

1. A classic line of poetry is typically a breath to say.
2. Most lines contain three or four "beads" of meter.
3. These metrical units create a rhythmic pattern.

## Analyzing a Poetic Line

Example: "Through the upper and lower worlds, body and soul,"

1. Identify the stressed syllables: UP, LOW, BOD, SOUL
2. Notice how these create a rhythmic pattern
3. Observe how the line naturally divides into metrical units

## The Function of Meter

- Meter strengthens the rhythm of language.
- It creates recognizable patterns.
- These patterns help connect the words to our physical experience.

## Exercise: Reading Aloud

1. Read the line aloud, emphasizing the stressed syllables.
2. Feel how your body responds to the rhythm.
3. Notice how the meter aids in remembering the line.

## Conclusion

Understanding the structure of poetic lines and their meter helps us appreciate the craft of poetry and its physical impact on readers and listeners.
