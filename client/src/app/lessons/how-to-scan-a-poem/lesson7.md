# Lesson 7: Variations in Meter - Trochees and Spondees

## Introduction

This lesson explores variations in metrical feet, focusing on trochees and spondees.

## Trochees

- A trochee is the opposite of an iamb.
- The pattern is stressed followed by unstressed (DUM-da).
- Examples: "apple," "water," "poet"

## Spondees

- A spondee consists of two stressed syllables (DUM-DUM).
- They're often used for emphasis or to break the rhythm.
- Examples: "heartbreak," "sundown," "football"

## Mixing Metrical Feet

- Poets often mix different types of feet for variety and effect.
- A predominantly iambic line might include a trochee or spondee for emphasis.

## Exercise: Identifying Metrical Variations

Read these lines and identify the metrical feet:

1. "Tyger! Tyger! burning bright" (William Blake)
2. "Break, break, break, / On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!" (Alfred Tennyson)

## The Effect of Metrical Variations

- Variations can create emphasis or surprise.
- They can mirror the meaning of the words.
- Understanding variations enhances our appreciation of a poet's skill.

## Conclusion

While iambs are the most common metrical foot in English poetry, understanding variations like trochees and spondees allows for a deeper appreciation of poetic rhythm and technique.
