# Lesson 5: Scansion - Marking Poetic Rhythm

## Introduction

This lesson introduces scansion, the process of marking the rhythms in poetry.

## What is Scansion?

- Scansion is the act of marking the stressed and unstressed syllables in a poem.
- It helps us understand and appreciate the basic pattern of a poem's meter.

## Steps of Scansion

1. Identify the stressed syllables (the "beats").
2. Mark the unstressed syllables.
3. Look for patterns in how these stressed and unstressed syllables are arranged.

## Scansion Symbols

- Use a "wand" symbol (´) over stressed syllables.
- Use a "cup" symbol (˘) over unstressed syllables.

## Example of Scansion

Using the line: "Through your softness and hardness, your wetness and roil,"

Mark it as:   ˘   ´    ˘    ´     ˘    ´     ˘    ˘    ´    ˘    ˘    ´
             Through your SOFT-ness and HARD-ness, your WET-ness and ROIL

## The Purpose of Scansion

- Reveals the underlying rhythm of the poem
- Helps in understanding the poet's craft
- Enhances our ability to read poetry aloud effectively

## Exercise: Practice Scansion

1. Take a line of poetry
2. Read it aloud, feeling for the natural stresses
3. Mark the stressed and unstressed syllables
4. Identify any patterns you see

## Conclusion

Scansion is a valuable tool for analyzing and appreciating poetry, allowing us to see and feel the rhythmic structure that gives a poem its musical quality.
